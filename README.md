In this repository uploaded are the pseudocode, flowchart, and source code files for a simple calculator program. 
The program allows users to select the arithmetic operation mode they desire.
In addition, the calculator program takes two integers and handles error for inputs that are non-integers and non-zero integers (for division operation).
Lastly, the program will continuously run until the user decided to stop using it.
